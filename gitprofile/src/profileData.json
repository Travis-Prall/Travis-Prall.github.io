        "description": "While it might seem that neurobiology, physiology and behavior are quite separate fields, the three interact extensively in living organisms to achieve common goals. By studying neurobiology, behavior and physiology from the perspectives of molecular and cellular biology, evolution, organ systems (neural, endocrine, cardiovascular, respiratory, immune, etc.) and the environment, students gain insight into how these aspects work together in a variety of ways. Students in this concentration also learn to apply principles from mathematics, chemistry and physics. Discoveries are made at the laboratory bench and in the field, and students in the concentration are encouraged to participate in research projects in the labs of our faculty members."
